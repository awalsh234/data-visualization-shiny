# Fright Night Data Visualization Project
Author: Annie Walsh
Date: July 2025

ðŸŽƒ Project Overview
This project explores interactive and animated data visualizations using a de-identified dataset from the SAN & AML Lab's 2019 Haunted House Study, where participants traversed the historic Eastern State Penitentiary and reported on their emotional and regulatory experiences.

The project demonstrates:

âœ… Data cleaning and wrangling with tidyverse
âœ… Static and interactive visualizations with ggplot2 and plotly
âœ… Animated visualizations with gganimate
âœ… A dynamic, user-controlled Shiny app for exploring the data interactively

The work reflects best practices in R-based data visualization and is designed for both teaching and portfolio purposes.

ðŸ“Š About the Dataset
Participants (PID) navigated Eastern State Penitentiary in small groups and identified:

10 emotionally significant events (Event) in chronological order

Specific emotions experienced (Emotion)

Emotional intensity (Emo.Extent) and regulation effort (Reg.Extent)

Additional individual differences:

Depression (BDI), Anxiety (STAI), Emotion Regulation tendencies (ERQ), Uncertainty Tolerance (IUS), and Fear levels during the experience (Fear_During)

Regulation strategy used: Distraction or Reappraisal

Note: Data has been pre-processed and de-identified for visualization purposes.
